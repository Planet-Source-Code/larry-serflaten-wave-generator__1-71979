Wave Generator DEMO
LFS (serflaten@usinternet.com)

See the ReadMe file in the WaveGenerator folder for more explicit explainations.

This demo was put together to help you understand how to use the WaveGenerator component.  It has a few demo forms, but the images you see on the forms, or the sounds you hear are not the primary part of the demo.  Showing the code used to make those images and sounds is the main reason for the demo.

The Wave Generator was designed to be simple to use.  Make the component and try it out!

Have fun!
